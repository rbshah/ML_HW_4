**CSCI-385 Machine Learning Projects**

This repository contains three machine learning projects developed as part of the CSCI-385 Machine Learning course. The projects showcase the use of neural networks with PyTorch to solve different tasks using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model for classification and prediction.

Projects Overview

1. GTSRB Dataset: Traffic Sign Classification

	•	Task: Classifying traffic signs from the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset.
	•	Model: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).
	•	Goal: Accurately identify traffic signs from a set of images, which is crucial for autonomous driving systems.

2. MNIST Dataset: Handwritten Digit Recognition

	•	Task: Classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
	•	Model: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).
	•	Goal: Achieve high accuracy in recognizing digits (0–9) from grayscale images.

3. Housing Price Dataset: Housing Price Prediction

	•	Task: Predicting house prices based on various features such as area, number of rooms, etc.
	•	Model: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).
	•	Goal: Estimate housing prices accurately given the input features, which can be applied to real-world real estate analysis.

Features

	•	Datasets: All datasets were sourced from Kaggle, including the MNIST, GTSRB, and Housing Price data.
	•	Training and Evaluation: The models were trained and evaluated using PyTorch. Each model’s performance is displayed via loss function and accuracy function graphs.
	•	Neural Network Architecture: The MLP architecture varies depending on the dataset, tuned to optimize performance for each specific task.
